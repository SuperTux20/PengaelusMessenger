A little chat app project I made for school. I wonder if I can take it further?

**Note: chat functionality has not yet been implemented. For now, this is a mere web-request-processing API demonstration**

## Usage
1. Clone this repo and run `npm run serve` in your terminal/command prompt.
2. Using software like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) (recommended for beginners) or [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) (you go Linux elites :sunglasses:), run POST, GET, DELETE, or PATCH requests with JSON objects that include `username` and `password` parameters.
