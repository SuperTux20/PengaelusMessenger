# Pengaelus Messenger API
A little chat API project I made for school. I wonder if I can take it further?

## Usage
1. Clone this repo and run `npm run serve` in your terminal/command prompt.
2. Using software like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) (recommended for beginners) or [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) (you go Linux elites :sunglasses:), run POST, GET, DELETE, or PATCH requests with JSON objects (see format in [user_demo](user_demo.sh) and [channel_demo](channel_demo.sh))
3. Of course, you could also run the demo scripts and watch the JSON files fill up and empty out again. They'll only work in Bash (so use Linux or WSL)
